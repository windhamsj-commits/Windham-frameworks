# Windham-frameworks
A living architecture of Dr. Steffany J. Windham’s frameworks for maternal–child health, community stabilization, relational belonging, and field‑level leadership.
# The Windham Frameworks  
### Architecture for Coherence, Belonging, and Field‑Level Change

This repository is the living archive of Dr. Steffany J. Windham’s frameworks, architectures, and systems for maternal–child health, community stabilization, and relational coherence. It is a place where truth becomes structure, where movement becomes form, and where each commit reflects a moment of clarity, integration, or expansion.

## Purpose  
To build, document, and evolve the frameworks that shape how individuals, families, and communities stabilize, connect, and thrive. This repository holds the foundational architectures that support:

- Maternal–child health leadership  
- Community support systems  
- Connection Officer training  
- Relational belonging and coherence  
- Field‑level stabilization and expansion  

Each framework is designed to be clear, teachable, scalable, and grounded in lived human experience.

## What This Repository Contains  
- **Core principles** that anchor each framework  
- **Architecture diagrams** and structural maps  
- **Training scripts and curriculum modules**  
- **Implementation guides** for real‑world practice  
- **Reflection prompts and integration tools**  
- **Documentation of field movements and updates**  

This is not static documentation. It is a living system.

## How This Repository Evolves  
Every commit represents a structural shift — a refinement, clarification, or expansion of the framework. Branches are used for emergent ideas, exploratory architectures, and new states of understanding before they are ready to be integrated.

Pull requests mark moments of integration: when an idea becomes stable enough to join the core architecture.

## Guiding Principles  
- **Clarity over complexity**  
- **Coherence over speed**  
- **Belonging as baseline**  
- **Structure that reflects truth**  
- **Movement that honors lived experience**
