ABSTRACT

Open Arms is a statewide, 24/7 residential maternal health and family preservation program designed to stabilize pregnant women at high risk of newborn foster care placement due to substance use disorders, untreated mental illness, domestic violence, homelessness, or poverty. The program integrates OB/GYN oversight, Women’s Health Nurse Practitioner (WHNP)‑led Centering Pregnancy, Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM)‑led routine vaginal deliveries, addiction medicine, psychiatric care, trauma‑informed therapy, and social services within a structured, trauma‑informed residential setting.

Open Arms addresses critical gaps in Louisiana’s maternal health system, where Medicaid‑mandated prenatal toxicology screenings frequently trigger DCFS involvement and potential newborn removal. The program provides a clinically robust, cost‑effective, autonomy‑centered alternative that improves maternal health outcomes, reduces maternal morbidity, increases prenatal care adherence, and strengthens family preservation.

Open Arms seeks federal support to expand capacity, improve statewide maternal‑infant outcomes, reduce substance‑exposed newborn removals, and establish a scalable model for national replication.

PROJECT NARRATIVE (HRSA 10‑PAGE FORMAT)

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Open Arms is a statewide maternal health and family preservation initiative designed to stabilize pregnant women at imminent risk of newborn foster care placement. The program integrates OB/GYN services, WHNP‑led Centering Pregnancy, CNM‑led routine deliveries, addiction medicine, psychiatric care, trauma‑informed therapy, and social services within a 24/7 residential setting.

This midwifery‑inclusive model aligns with HRSA’s Maternal and Child Health (MCH) priorities by expanding access to prenatal care, reducing maternal morbidity, supporting culturally responsive birthing options, and lowering costs through evidence‑based, collaborative practice.

II. STATEMENT OF NEED

II.A Maternal Health Disparities in Louisiana

Louisiana ranks among the highest in the nation for maternal morbidity and mortality, particularly among women experiencing poverty, behavioral health conditions, and limited access to prenatal care. Pregnant women with substance use disorders or untreated mental illness face significant barriers to care, resulting in late or inconsistent prenatal engagement.

II.B Medicaid‑Mandated Toxicology Screening

State Medicaid programs require urine drug screening at the first prenatal visit. Positive toxicology results trigger mandatory DCFS reports, often leading to prenatal investigations, court involvement, and potential newborn removal. Without coordinated intervention, these women struggle to meet court‑ordered requirements.

II.C Fragmented Services

Existing services are siloed and outpatient. Transportation barriers, unstable housing, and untreated behavioral health conditions contribute to missed appointments and perceived non‑compliance. Few programs provide integrated prenatal care, addiction treatment, mental health services, and social services in a single setting.

II.D Lack of Midwifery‑Inclusive Models

Louisiana lacks residential programs that incorporate:

• WHNP‑led prenatal care
• CNM‑led low‑risk deliveries
• Water births and holistic birthing options
• Trauma‑informed labor support


These services are cost‑effective, evidence‑based, and strongly aligned with HRSA’s emphasis on expanding access to high‑quality maternal care in underserved populations.
